- Start by promising something they will learn at the end. Bottom line up front. Or a similar hook.
- Constantly cycle through your main ideas.
- Have a symbol and a slogan for your ideas.
- Give a surprise example.
- Final slide should not be thank you, but your contributions, your arguments, how you validated your argument, and why the audience should care and do moving forward.
- Tell stories. Stores influence ideas, offer explanations, or elevate control.

# Practicing
1. Practicing 1-2 minute impromptu speaking every day by myself by going on a random question generator or go on AskReddit and respond to the questions right away out loud for 1-2 minutes. Record and assess.
2. To sit in solemn silence in a dull dark dock. In a pestilential prison with a life long lock. Awaiting the sensation of a short sharp shock. From a cheap and chippy chopper on a big, black block.
3. In tooting two tutors astute tried to tute a duke on a flute. But duets so grueling end only in dueling when tutors astute toot the flute.

2. Practice until the core structure develops. Divide sentences between short and longer forms.
3. Edit the words down and transition to using cue cards with key words or points. Add cues to speed up or emphasize certain words.
4. At the end of each section, repeat the main point and pause
5. Tennis ball rule: when you should begin speaking is the time it takes for a tennis ball to travel to the back of the room and back to you
6. A script should be a story, see [[effective storytelling]]

Have a backup plan for a failed joke.

## Ending
1. Use power of three (pattern of 3)
2. End with story
3. Surprising fact
4. Thanking people (research, project, presenting data)
5. Short, memorable sentence or interesting quote, rhetoric question in the end
