# Avoid These Mistakes
1. The Founder/CEO is a salesperson role and will maintain that role for a long time. Their entirety is to raise capital, recruit, and sell.
2. Don't try to figure it all out yourself without a guide.
3. Don't listen to late-stage advice for early-stage companies.
4. Outsourcing the search or not focusing for [[Product Market Fit]].
6. Set poor goals with no real trackable metric.
7. Bad hires and slow fires.
8. Slow iteration and ship speed. Iterate as fast as possible, and learn based on user reactions, and repeat. Understand the importance of [[Startup Growth Rates]].
9. No defined ICP (based on company size, job, pain point, culture, tech stack, business type, price point, location, etc).
10. Don't start a company with someone you can't like or trust just because they have a skill you need. People and team is the most important.
11. Receiving funding doesn't make you invincible. Maintain your burn rate. Work on product, not marketing.
12. Running out of cash, not having [[Product Market Fit]], and not having the right team is the top 3 reasons why startups fail.
13. Lack of focus. Solve a single well-defined problem.
14. Solutions in search of a problem.
15. Understand that building a two-sided marketplace is challenging. Overcoming the cold start problem is extremely difficult.
16. Lack of industry expertise can be a major dealbreaker. Ensure you have some sort of experience or unique insight.
17. Don't follow the 'Netflix Canada Rule' - chase low hanging fruits and not focusing on scaling value adders. Always aim to capture a large percentage of a niche market than expanding.

# Starting a Startup
1. File a 83B
2. Put these contracts into writing:
	1. 4 year vesting period with 1 year cliff. If the cofounder leaves before year 1, then don't keep any equity. After a year, their equity raises per month until 4 years.
	2. IP is always owned by corporation
	3. Ensure right of first refusal: If someone wants to sell their shares, they must offer the corporation a chance to complete a buy back instead of selling to an outside party
	4. Capital Contributions: The amount of capital contributed to the venture by each co-founder.
	5. Dissolution: An explanation of rights that each party holds if the company is dissolved.
	6. Transfer of Shares: Determines whether shares can be transferred and defines who they can be transferred to.
	7. Drag-Along Rights: Stipulations that enables a majority shareholder to force a minority shareholder to join in the sale of a company. The majority owner doing the dragging must give the minority shareholder the same price, terms and conditions as any other seller.
	8. Death/Disability: The actions that take place if a co-founder passes or is incapacitated.
	9. Executive Power: Who can fire whom? This details the way in which a company can remove a cofounder under extraordinary circumstances
3. Manage division of labor. Assign responsibilities to identify accountability.

3. Something few realize are worth doing.

5. Typically organic.
6. First-mover advantage is fake. "It's exceptionally rare for startups to be killed by competitors — so rare that you can almost discount the possibility."
7. Better a good idea with competitors than a bad one without.
8. Not a derivative of an existing product (Uber but for X, a better Adobe, etc).
9. A problem should be popular or growing, urgent, expensive, mandatory, and frequent.
10. Solid answer to “Of all the things you could be doing with your life, why this?” Founders need to love the problem and have a purpose behind it. Can you answer, [[Why Are You Capable to Solve the Problem]]?
11. A team's unfair advantage is either founder advantage, market advantage, product advantage, and network/winner-takes-all effects.

# Hiring
As a leader, aim to provide low stake environments for people to collaborate on projects together. It benefits the company as a whole. Make sure to allow teams from multiple departments to work together and collaborate.

Slow hires, fast fires. Having an A++ early team pays dividends in the future. Guideline is 50-100 hours per hire. Reevaluate in 3 months. An early team should show a [[Defining Resilience]], but most importantly, trust and similar values.
