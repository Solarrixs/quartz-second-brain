1. Learn [[Saying No]]. Focus is underrated.
2. Invest for your future: [[Leadership MOC]], [[Interview MOC]], [[Resume, Cover Letters, and Networking MOC]], [[Health MOC]], and [[Founder MOC]]. These provide [[Superlinear Returns]].
3. Read [[Attributes of Great People]] and [[Increasing Luck Surface Area]]. See where you can improve.
4. Build your habit to staying active early.
5. Read [[List of Productivity Advice]].
6. Be interesting: find a hobby you enjoy unrelated to your job. Travel as a young and single individual after college, which is cheaper than you can expect.
7. Take risks. Make asymmetrical bets. It's easier to do this early in your life.
8. Be intentional about maintaining your friendships after school. Don't be the reason your relationships stagnate.
9. Early in your life, [[Be a Generalist]].
10. If you're not sure what you want to do in the future, consider [[The 3 Career Paths]].
12. Have your own [[Self-Authenticity]]. People around you will doubt you. Practice coming up with your own worldview. In another way, being a weird teenager is good. You can go against the flow. Pursue weird things that you want to pursue, not the standard path. *But do have good social skills.*
13. Get good at writing and [[Public Speaking]]. This is one of the highest ROI skills you can develop. Study the [[Persuasion Masterclass]], read [[The 48 Laws of Power]], and know your worth to sell your value.
14. In terms of communication: convey visible facial emotions to mimic how other people feel, say less about your life and practice [[Active Listening]], and always seek to compliment.
15. Go deep on multiple things to get a sense for what kinds of things you enjoy doing, which probably won't change over the course of your life. What's the shape like?
16. Collect questions and save them onto notes and read the questions. Having [[My Feynman Questions List]] fosters interconnected thinking.
17. Find friends that show a [[Defining Resilience]]. Trust, optimists, and similar values are also the most important qualities you can find in a person. Don't compromise on that. Also note that you don't have to be liked by everyone. A solid smaller group of friends is always better than being well liked by everyone who aren't close with you.
18. Happiness isn't about success in the end. It's about friendship. Core tenets are outlined in [[Happy, Meaningful and Psychologically Rich Life]].
19. Study the [[Important Frameworks]] for helping you make judgements in life.
20. Invest first, spend second.
21. Learn the [[Job Hopping Requirements]]. Money is never the priority.
22. Understand [[Focus and Attention Spans]] for optimal focus and productivity gains.
23. Remember consistency is the key to a better life. [[The days are long but the decades are short]]. Keep focusing on the daily compounding activities, and your decades will be happy.
