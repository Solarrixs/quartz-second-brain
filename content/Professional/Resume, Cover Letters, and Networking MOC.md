## Questions to Answer
- How did you know your role was a great fit for you?
- What aspects of your personality work well in this role?
- What are some of the skills most valuable in this role?
- What are some situations you used those skills?
- What are some skills you would still like to gain if you had chance to do so?
- What are some of the key challenges you face in this role and how did you approach and overcome them in a specific example?
- What was one of your most engaging projects in your current role, why?

For many of the stories you hear from coffee chats, mirror it during your own interviews using your own skills and experiences instead.

## Cover Letter Guideline
- Why this job? Why your skills? Why your experiences? Why apply here?
- Narrative stories about you. Expanding on info from resume, not repeating info. Focus on just one to two relevant experiences to elaborate on that highlight why you are the "right" person for the role.
- Sharing a bit of you as a person.
- Show your passion and emotional intelligence.
- Add personal emotional language: "It was exciting, wonderful to see, meant a lot, enjoyed, passionate about x, dynamic, unique"
- "I have always sought out these roles where I can bring these ideas. *Examples using the star method with emotions and relevance*."
- "Unlike other candidates you're seeing that probably have XYZ trait, I have ABC trait because of my experience at XYZ company."

**Open with:**
- I am applying for this role at X that was advertised on X, and that your colleague NAME recommended that I apply to."
- List your degree at your university and your quick experience.
- Why your combination of skills would be a great fit for this role.
- Get your brand names into the first paragraph.
- Mention the names of people in the firm you've spoken to, what they said about the firm, and why what they said got you interested in the firm.
