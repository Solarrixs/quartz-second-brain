# Giving an Interview
Always have a goal before [[Giving Behavioral Interviews]].

## Sample Interview
1. What were you hired to do?
	1. Gain an insight about the mission of their hire was, key outcomes, what skills were needed
2. What accomplishments are you most proud of?
	1. This should mirror the role you are looking to fill. If not and they talk about people they met or aspects of the job they liked, they're not going deep enough and is a red flag.
3. What were some low points of the job?
4. What was your bosses name? How do you spell it? What was it like working with them?
	1. Act like you will call their boss. You will hear what a candidate will say about you if you hired them.
5. What will they tell me about your strengths and weaknesses?
	1. People should know about their weaknesses. The weaknesses is the important part.
6. Why did you leave?
	1. Good people are recruited or promoted, B/C players are pushed out.

**To get interesting insights from people, ask:**
1. To what do you attribute your success (not luck)?
2. What's the hardest thing you've done?
3. What unfair secrets have you learned to accelerate your growth?

# Interview Tips
1. Show how you think to show reasoning skills. Think out loud.
2. Give clues to who you are. Reference books you read, hobbies you explored, and ideas that reflect about yourself.
3. Share your unique cross-section - a combination of attributes that separate you from everyone else. In my case, semiconductor / nanotechnology related major is very critical in business investments now, and my inherent development in neuroscience and neurotechnology research attributes to my success in AI and computer science. I also have startup and venture capital experience, showcasing my ability to be in-depth in both a company's business side and technical side.
4. Before your interview, think of ways your hobby shows off your soft, transferable skills. For example, if your hobby is painting, it shows creativity, attention to detail, and patience.
5. Know your resume and be able to talk about every single thing on it and why you choose it and your most memorable moments there.

# Common Interview Questions to Prepare
1. Tell me about yourself.
	1. star School name, major, 2-3 relevant experiences (keep it short with just position and one key achievement), introduce your catalyst that led you to become interested in the current job, and then 2 unique things about you (hobbies).
2. What is your proudest achievement?
3. Where do you see in 5/10 years?
4. Describe yourself.
5. What would you do differently?
6. If you had 6 months with no obligations and no financial constraints, what would you do.
7. What's your definition of success/leadership?
8. What was a time you solved a conflict/problem?
9. Biggest strength/weakness/success/failure/challenge?
10. What's your involvement in ECs?
11. Share something not on your resume that you'd like me to know about you.
12. Any interesting things you want to explain to me in 5 minutes?
13. How do you manage time and prioritize?
14. What would other people say about you?
