# 2024
1. It is hard to be wildly successful at anything you aren't obsessed with.
2. Before getting swept up in the competitions that define so much of life, ask yourself whether you even want the prize on offer.
3. Thinking long-term is the biggest overlooked advantage hidden in plain sight.
4. Statistically speaking, a “normal person” is physically unhealthy, emotionally anxious/depressed, socially lonely, and financially in debt. Don't be normal.
5. Yes is easy, but carries a burden. No is hard, but enables you to focus on the more important things.
6. Expend energy so that you can eventually find the few things you do exceptionally well. But the experimentation phase has to end eventually.
7. The more focused you are, the easier it is to become world-class at whatever you commit to.
8. Opportunities multiply as they are seized. Risk multiply the opportunities seized.
9. The best people are the least likely to jump through hoops to earn trust. And they're the first to vote with their feet and avoid people they don't think are trustworthy.
10. We feel like we need more time, but what we're craving is more focus. What we need is a smaller surface area.
11. Most of my close friends only have 4-5 close friends. Most of the productive people I know at work are focused on one or two things, not 5. The way to maximize your enjoyment in life is to keep your surface area small. It's a lot of work but if the happiest people I know are any indication, it's a lot less work to keep it small than to maintain it when it's large.
12. Stress comes from ignoring things that you shouldn’t be ignoring.
13. No one knows how it will turn out. You really do need to fuck around to find out.
14. It’s depressing how lossy all our attempts at communication are, written or otherwise.
15. If you’re overconfident, you’ll try things that fail, and people will laugh at you. If you’re under confident, you’ll avoid making risky bets, and miss out on the potential upside, but nobody will know for sure what you missed. That means it’s always tempting to do what the low-info heuristic tells you and be less ambitious—but ultimately, that ends up being worse for the world.
16. Everyone enjoys winning. What matters is do you enjoy the preparation?
17. Mentors and peers shouldn't only be within your field. Make a list of your top mentors, and aggressively pursue them, both in and out of your field.
18. There is a world of difference between something that’s impossible and something that’s almost impossible.
19. If you don't sacrifice for what you want, what you want becomes the sacrifice.
20. The measure of a man is what he does when he has power.
21. The common trait of people who supposedly have vision is that they spend a lot of time reading and gathering information, and then they synthesize it until they come up with an idea.
22. In the short term, you are as good as your intensity. In the long term, you are only as good as your consistency. Amateurs have a goal. Professionals have a system.
23. Take as much risk as you can afford. If you're not failing, you're being too conservative. When in doubt, then, follow your curiosity, and fail there. That'll bring you to the frontiers of knowledge, where there are many gaps for you to explore.
24. I very frequently get the question: "What's going to change in the next 10 years?" And that is a very interesting question; it's a very common one. I almost never get the question: "What's not going to change in the next 10 years?" And I submit to you that that second question is actually the more important of the two -- because you can build a business strategy around the things that are stable in time... we know that customers want low prices, and I know that's going to be true 10 years from now. They want fast delivery; they want vast selection. It's impossible to imagine a future 10 years from now where a customer comes up and says, "Jeff I love Amazon; I just wish the prices were a little higher," or "I love Amazon; I just wish you'd deliver a little more slowly." Impossible. And so the effort we put into those things, spinning those things up, we know the energy we put into it today will still be paying off dividends for our customers 10 years from now. When you have something that you know is true, even over the long term, you can afford to put a lot of energy into it.
25. What we consider defining moments matter less to life satisfaction than the accumulation of tiny moments that didn't seem to matter at the time. In the end, everyday moments matter more than big prizes. Tiny delights over big bright lights.
26. Potential isn't about where you start but how far you'll travel.
27. People who struggle early build the skills to excel later.
28. Don't work for anyone you don't respect or admire, and only work with people you enjoy. Limit exposure to toxic negative people.
29. Intrinsic motivation: Autonomy + mastery + sense of purpose.
30. Improving personal inputs improves output. Treat your daily habits as non-negotiable priorities.
31. If I’m building a health-care company, I don’t want a health-care CEO. If I’m building a manufacturing company, I don’t want a manufacturing CEO. I want somebody really smart to rethink the assumptions from the ground up. After all, retail innovation did not come from Walmart; it came from Amazon. Media innovation did not come from Time magazine or CBS; it came from YouTube and Twitter and Facebook. Space innovation did not come from Boeing and Lockheed; it came from Elon Musk’s SpaceX. Next-generation cars did not come from GM and Volkswagen; they came from another Musk company, Tesla. **I can’t think of a single, major innovation coming from experts in the last thirty, forty years.**
32. Driving is the last time most adults learn a new skill. Never stop learning.
33. We spend 99% of our lives working towards moments that will encompass a mere 1% of our lives, then we feel nostalgic about the 99%.
34. I'm so glad you're talking to me about this.
35. Outsized returns often come from betting against conventional wisdom, and conventional wisdom is usually right. Given a ten percent chance of a one hundred times payoff, you should take that bet every time.
36. Where do I think the next amazing revolution is going to come? There’s no question that digital biology is going to be it. For the very first time in our history, in human history, biology has the opportunity to be engineering, not science.
37. The days are long but the decades are short.
38. Luck is the intersection of preparation and opportunity. Opportunities parade past all of us all the time. The key is that you must be paying attention to see them, you must be willing to take risks, you must expose yourself to the possibility of massive failure and you must believe in what you are doing so much that you do it anyway.
39. If I’d asked customers what they wanted, they would have told me, ‘A faster horse!'
40. The most powerful productivity tool ever invented is simply the word no.
41. The person who carefully designs their daily routine goes further than the person who negotiates with themselves every day.
42. It's easier to build a hard company than an easy one. If you're building a photo-sharing app, nobody bothers. But if you're building flying cars, supersonic aeroplanes or nuclear power startups people proactively want to help you for free because they want to be a part of this interesting thing.
43. The opposite of a good idea is a good idea.
