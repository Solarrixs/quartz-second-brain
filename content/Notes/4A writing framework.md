# 4A Framework
1. Take a topic and pick a direction: actionable (here's how), analytical (numbers), aspiration (yes, you can), anthropological (here's why)
	1. Actionable: tips, hacks, resources, guides
	2. Analytical: trends, numbers, fact based
	3. Aspirational: lessons, mistakes, reflections, how to get started, what you would do again
	4. Anthropological: fears, failures, struggles
2. Choose an approach for your topic (how to, lessons learned, mistakes)
3. Leverage reader credibility (explain why you're the expert, source another real expert, or share personal experience)

## Other Frameworks
**Problem, Agitate, Solution**
Identify a problem that the target reader is facing (pain point, challenge, unfulfilled need)
- agitate the problem by highlighting negative consequences of not solving it. create urgency and a feeling of "needing to take action"
- offer a solution that address the problem and solves it. it has to be clear, actionable, and easy to understand.

**Hooking**
- Raise a question without giving away the answer: Leave the reader wanting to know more. Motivate them to engage and seek out further information. (Can you explain...; Have you ever wondered...; What's the story behind?)
- Highlight the accolades of a story without offering the reason why: Create a sense of curiosity and anticipation. Prompt the reader to seek out the reason behind the achievement and engage with the story. (The reason why is not what you might expectâ€¦)
- Show a common problem without providing the solution: Create a sense of empathy and understanding, highlight a shared experience and prompt people to seek out solutions and alternatives. (You're not alone if you've experienced...)
