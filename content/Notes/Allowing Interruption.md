As a leader, you should encourage good interruptions. You can’t waste precious minutes on tangents or issues you and the team are already aligned on.

So, as a leader:
- Start with "I know we’re short on time, and have a lot to cover. Feel free to raise your hand if I’m going too far down a direction you already know, or if you have questions along the way. The goal for today is to X and I’ll start by sharing a bit about Y and Z."
- When someone interrupts, answer the question quickly and return back to the main point.

And as a listener:
- Are you cool if I interrupt if you’re sharing stuff I already know or agree with? We only have 30 min and a lot to cover, so I want to make sure we get what we need.

- If you can't begin with that, then you can raise your hand or interrupt and apologize.
