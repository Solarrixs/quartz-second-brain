To decline:
1. Decline with a reason.
2. Decline and counteroffer.
3. Buy more time to decide.

To accept under certain constraints:
1. Accept but ask what to deprioritize.
2. Accept but ask for something in return.

A good heuristic is to say no to everything unless you feel a "fuck yeah" response. Micro-gains accumulate a lot more than one would expect, and its important to keep that focus on one thing you want to do very well. Distractions take your leverage and make you poor. Focus makes you rich. If not money, then in time. Anything you don't want to do, don't do. Life is too short, and there is too many cool shit for you to be wasting your time.

In a way, being lazy demonstrates your willingness to say no. Laziness allows you to be selective about your time. The key is to focus on the work that matters most.

Alternatively, there is only one risk: not seizing every opportunity that you can in this life, because you won't get those chances again. You think the risk is screwing up? The real risk is never trying.
