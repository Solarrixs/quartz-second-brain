# Guide
Invest to shorten your iteration cycles.
Aim for modular and upgradable prototypes.
Avoid reinventing every wheel. Reuse technologies if they are efficient and capable.

When designing a prototype, think about the goals and success criteria.
- Test hypothesis and collect information
- Ensure design meets engineering criteria
- Does it meet the North Star?
- What's your adaptable roadmap?

Hardware companies generally have economies of scale and are defensible, but lack network effects. The best startups thus integrate hardware with software to act as platform or network effects. Hardware for the revenue and software for the margin.

Proper planning is essential in hardware companies. It's different from software's rapid iteration.
- For example, you might create a design that fails environmental tests but only discover this years later when you are about to go to market.

## Prototyping
Experiment with many different versions of your product, before slowly eliminating bad options and making improvements to a final one. MVP is the goal for now.

Use fast CAD and 3D printing.

# Manufacturing
Most hardware startups stumble during the manufacturing and scaling phase. The difficulty of manufacturing alone is one reason that hardware entrepreneurs tend to have more work experience than software entrepreneurs.

This phase mainly involves finding manufacturers or suppliers, but also factoring storage, shipping, and warehousing costs.

Most likely, you will source from overseas in China. Go on Alibaba and try to find a manufacturer that creates goods similar to your idea. Make sure the manufacturers is a gold supplier, verified, and have trade assurance on their Alibaba page.

Narrow a list of 5 or so manufacturers, then you want quotes. Make sure to answer these questions:
1. Can they accommodate custom orders? Do they have the skills? The resources? Do they have automation features?
2. What are their leads times? How long will it take to produce and ship items?
3. What are shipping costs? Shipping makes up a massive portion of small business expenses.
4. What are their minimum order quantities (MOQs)? Don’t lead with this question. It’ll make you look like a beginner and deter manufacturers from working with you. However, you’ll want to know the minimum amount of items you have to order before they start producing your product. This is highly negotiable.
5. What is the cost per unit? While you’re negotiating MOQs, you’ll also want to negotiate cost per unit. The larger the order, the lower your cost per unit can be.
6. Are there setup fees involved?
7. What’s their defect policy? Find out who eats the cost for incorrect or defective items. Who pays for the shipping and duties?
8. For payment terms, ask for 50% upfront, 50% after shipment is received.
