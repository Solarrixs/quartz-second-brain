People with outstanding resilience typically understand:
1. Suffering is a part of life and doesn't discriminate.
2. There are things you can change, and a lot of things you can't. Focus on what you're grateful for and accept what's been good to you.
3. Find appropriate times for grief so to not harm others. Don't remain stuck in the pit of despair.

On a broader note, these individuals demonstrate a belief in their self-control and influence on outcomes, are committed to their goals, and have vast social connections to recover from failure.

One great quote related to that topic is as follows: “Winners focus on Winning. Losers focus on Winners.” Its important to train your mind to focus on your goal, not other people. To develop self-confidence, yet the self-awareness to work on yourself.
