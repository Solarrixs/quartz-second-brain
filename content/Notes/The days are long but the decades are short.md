Sam Altman's 30 year old advice for the younger generation.

1. Always put your family, friends, and significant friends and other first. Keep close friends over acquaintances. Don't lose touch with old friends. Stay up and talk. Develop personal connections and identify talented people. Talk to people more. Don't burn bridges.
2. It is so important to be around smart, interesting, ambitious people. Work and hire them.
3. Cut negative relationships out. Hire slow, fire fast.
4. Do what makes you happy and fulfilled - few people get remembered into history.
5. Find the right thing to do early in your life. The right sectors. At least you know what you like and don't like.
6. Believe in yourself, especially when others tell you it's not going to work. It's hard to identify what to work on because original thought is hard, but once you find it, do it.
7. Money may or may not buy happiness, but it can buy freedom. Freedom is important. Freedom to travel, spent on friends, saving time, etc.
8. Wasting time is most people's biggest regret. Don't. Focus on what you really want to do. If you think you’re going to regret not doing something, you should probably do it.  Regret is the worst, and most people regret far more things they didn’t do than things they did do.
9. Similarly, don't be afraid to do something reckless and work hard towards it. You'll learn a lot. Most people are too risk-averse. Do new things often - something big new and risky.
10. Be nice, even if it doesn't matter. Forgive.
11. Do, don't talk.
