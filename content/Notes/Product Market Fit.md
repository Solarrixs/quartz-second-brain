# Determining PMF
Ask customers:
1. How would you feel if you could no longer use our product? Would you be very disappointed (ideally 40%), somewhat disappointed, or not disappointed?
2. What type of person would most benefit from this product? (A customer should describe themself. If not, wrong product or customer fit.)
3. What's the main benefit you get from this product?
4. How can we improve this product for you?

It's also important to know who isn't using your product. Why not, and is it worth expanding to that group?
- ! Encountering demand outside of your ICP may seem good, but be careful about supporting these customers and expanding. It might cause your ICP to fray.

# Achieving Faster PMF
Shorten the loop on how fast you can ship, get feedback, and work on new features. This could mean:
1. Mockups > code
2. Ship single and independent features
3. Give customers your personal phone number

# Signs of Fake PMF
1. Securing funding from renowned funds or individuals doesn't mean PMF.
2. Companies focus on building the company and not the users and product.
3. Genuine PMF is a product breaking in a good way due to increased usage by users who align with the economics you desire (low CAC high LTV)
4. Not setting a single North Star metric and constantly changing it
5. Creating solutions for problems.

# PMF Metrics
- Saves people time (reduce friction or just more time efficient)
- Makes or saves money
- Easy adoption
- Adds insights
