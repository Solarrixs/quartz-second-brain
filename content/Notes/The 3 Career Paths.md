If you have no idea what you want to do as a career:
1. Take the most prestigious job possible. This is a permanent status signal that can open doors to your life and provide exit opportunities.
2. Take the most interesting job that is fun and unique and can provide you a unique perspective in the world.
3. Take the job with the best mentor possible or with the best chance of learning to accelerate your future development.

Optimising for learning over money when you are starting wins in the long term. The knowledge gathered during the first years will compound and it will allow you to get higher-paying and more impactful jobs in the long term.
