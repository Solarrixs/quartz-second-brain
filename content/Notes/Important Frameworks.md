# Bottom Line Up Front
Start writing or conversations with the conclusions first. What action needs to be done? What do you need? What's your main recommendation or idea?

Then add supporting details to back your conclusion.

Finally, add the full context.

# Feedback Reflection
Start with situation when the behavior occurs. Describe it specifically - what someone did or what you saw.

Describe the impact the behavior had on you. What you thought, felt, and how it could impact the team.

Ask about the intention for the behavior, and repeat their reflection on their behavior.

# Exponential Order Thinking
When making a decision:
1. What's the immediate effect?
2. What's the 1 month effect?
3. What's the 1 year effect?
4. What's the 1 decade effect?

Weigh decisions based on their asymmetry for success over the long term.

# Ladders of Inference
1. Look at the data. Which did I ignore or pay attention to, and why?
2. How did I interpret that data? Was it objective?
3. Did I have correct assumptions? Why do I assume this?
4. What beliefs do I hold about this topic as a whole?

# Hubspot's Flashtags
Feedback should have systems to determine their level of influence.
1. FYI
2. Suggestion
3. Recommendation
4. Plea

# Catalyst Review Forums
1. Ensure everyone has 1 hour free blocks on the same time multiple days a week.
2. Allow people to mark themselves as interested, drivers, makers, or brain trust for meetings during those times.
	1. Drivers run the meeting and decision processes.
	2. Makers execute.
	3. Braintrust act as guides.
	4. Interested are for people to follow along.

# Dory and Pulse
1. People submit anonymous questions that are upvoted or downvoted by "stars" by other people. Everyone is equal.
2. Pulse the room and figure out what topics are of most interest.

# Launching Rockets
1. All projects should have a single leader who holds accountability.
2. Successful launches means a launch of a toy rocket.

# SPADE
Consensus is impractical and ineffective since there is no ownership. what's important is that everyone is listened to, not everyone agrees. and then the right person makes a decision, communicates it, and rallies people around it.

There should be a spade log that archives previous ones.

## Setting
- What is the precise decision to be made
- Why does it matter? Why are we making it?
- What's the deadline? Why?

## People
- Approver can veto the decision but used rarely
- Include as many people as possible - who should consult, approve, and a single person who is responsible for this decision and its execution

## Alternative
- Brainstorm openly and publicly for alternatives
- Should be feasible, different, comprehensive

## Decide
- Private anonymous votes until at the end when all is revealed
- Main decision maker takes their inputs into consideration, pro and cons of alternatives, and decide with explanation

## Explain
- Email or note to team about the SPADE doc on why the choice is made
- Call a commitment meeting and explain to everyone your choice.
