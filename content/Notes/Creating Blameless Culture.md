Creating an environment and culture where people can make mistakes and not get blamed is crucial:
1. Psychological safety - people openly disagree, leading to great and healthy team discussions.
2. People can make mistakes and learn fast. Everyone grows faster if they don't get shamed for it.
3. People love to collaborate and help each other, instead of being in an competitive environment.
4. Don't bring problems, but bring solutions to the table. Never blame and put out solutions, but always offer to work to bring together a solution.
