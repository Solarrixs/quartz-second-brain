The phrase "what you get out is what you put in" is false.
- If your product is only half as good as your competitor's, you don't get half as many customers. you get none.
- If your basketball team is only 10% worse, you lose the entire game, not 10% of the game.

Thus it's important to seek compounding work that provide superlinear returns. For example, building infrastructure, SEO, or growing an audience.

A good heuristic is to always be learning. If you're not, you're probably not on the superlinear path. Take multiple shots and hope that one achieves superlinear returns. This is another reason to start taking risks early at a young age.

People should shoot for superlinear returns if:
- They know they're good enough to be ahead of most people in a higher risk path
- Young people who can afford that risk to try it out

When in doubt, follow your curiosity. It never lies, and it knows more than you do about what's worth paying attention to.
