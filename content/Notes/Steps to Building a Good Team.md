Remember this. Control isn't everything. And delegation isn't about abdicating all responsibility but unlocking hidden potential of others to empower your team members.
1. Match tasks to people's skills and interests. Invest in understanding your team's strengths and passions. Allocate tasks that ignite their inner fire, not stifle it. Sometimes, that means not giving tasks to the people most capable of doing them, but to the one who wants it to do the most.
2. Equip your team with resources, tools, and guidance they need to navigate the task.
3. Attack the problem, not the person. Offer constructive feedback: Help them refine their technique, then you will gain in the long run.
4. Shift your mindset! See yourself as the maestro, inspiring and leading the team to create a harmonious symphony.
5. Hire slow but hire right, and trust your hire. Prioritize character, trust, and skills when recruiting. Demonstrate zero tolerance for deceit.
6. Collaboration builds more than competition. Transfer of knowledge is critical in understanding goals and skills. Everyone should feel as a part of something bigger, without suffocating under excessive reliance on each other.
7. Every opinion matters - everyone should contribute to a diverse range of opinions.
8. A singular person must own the outcomes of their opinions and the following actions. This is a common attribute among [[Important Frameworks]].
9. Have the mindset of "strong opinions held with probability" and be willing to "disagree but commit". Idea attachment is detrimental.
