1. Through the stories they tell, look to see if the end result of the thing they did would have been significantly worse without their involvement. Try to separate their actions from those of their team or the circumstance. This quality should both highlight their talents and their sense of agency and individuality.
	1. Do they have creativity?
	2. Resourcefulness and follow-through of projects
	3. "Tell me about your best X."
2. Navigate the world on their own terms. The best high potential youth are often unconventional in some ways. And if you’re looking for someone unconventional and high potential, they’ll often have a rationale for their unconventional approach.  Ideally they can describe their weird path in an internally coherent way without being egotistical or defensive.
	1. Thoughtful vision for the future
	2. Tell me about you. If your life was a book, give me the chapter titles from your birth till now.” Once you’ve gotten the overview, dive into each “chapter” and plumb the depths for their real stories. Go back to their childhood! I learn a lot about their grit and commitment to excellence from their basketball obsession or maybe their experience caring for a dying parent.
3. Determine if they have a chip on their shoulder. Do they have something to prove? Where’s the hole they’re looking to fill? Ideally, you’d get someone with obvious talent/drive that is misunderstood by the world. Those types of people will run through walls to reconcile their internal view of themselves with external perception. 
	1. Look for security and optimism.
	2. Make sure to resonate with their experiences.
	3. Highlight challenges in the company and see if they are eager to tackle the problems and prove themselves. It's important to see how they react.
4. Theory for excellence. "Excellence" is a surprisingly generalizable skill. People who've been great at *anything* are more likely to have the drive and self-discipline to excel even at something unrelated.
	1. Excellence is not popularity though.
	2. They know what they are good and bad at. They should already be aware of what tools they gravitate towards and what they over-use.
5. Openness. They need to be open to being coached and trained (responding well to feedback, being self-aware to assess their performance) and have the ability to disagree and commit.
	1. Check references and do work interviews where you purposely disagree with them.
6. They don't take themselves seriously. Can laugh at themselves. Should be pleasure to be around.
