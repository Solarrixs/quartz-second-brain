1. What's your worldview (have you written it down)? Does that conform to society? Is your worldview what sets you apart?
2. Do you have faith in your worldview? If yes, what do you do to achieve it? If you have an idea, what do you do about it?
3. What are 5 issues you have strong opinions about?
4. Do you spend a lot of time chasing goals you set yourself, and not imposed on you by other people? Are any of the goals you’re chasing _yours?_ Or are they the same goals that everyone else around you has?
5. What's one thing you can do that nobody else is willing to, or even can do? Is that unique to your worldview?
6. What are you passionate about?
7. What's the type of work you would like to do in the future?
