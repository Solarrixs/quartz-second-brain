The constraints that startups have are also the advantages they have. The reason big companies can't achieve this is because things at scale are superlinearly harder. For them, even a simple change is difficult and expensive.

## Taking risks that can't be quantified at the current.
When a larger company decides to take a risk, like launching a new product line or entering a new market, they need to create a detailed analysis of the opportunity and estimate cost in time and money. If there isn't a good ROI and that the risk of failure is low, it won't be undertaken.

If risk is impossible to ascertain, but the potential upside is high, incumbents are unlikely to follow.

## Leveraging new technology
When a tech is new, the risk is high. Maybe it won't be supported, maybe it won't take off, maybe it has a big security problem.

The startup takes a risk on that technology. Worst case, you lose your investment. 0x returns. But if you don't die, then it means you've built a sustainable company. Best case? 100x returns. The upside is high, the downside is typical.
