1. Leave long blocks of free, uninterrupted time (1 hour+) for doing especially difficult work.
2. Batch work meetings close together (and similar tasks together).
3. Break work into small pieces, and set goals that relate to finishing one small piece at a time.
4. For hard projects that you don't know where to start, mentally think about what you are going to do before you actually do it to help you prep.
5. Involve other people in projects in such a way that they rely on you to get your parts done.
6. Be aware of when your motivation and energy levels are highest.
7. Use multiple projects to your advantage (motivation switching).
8. Work in an environment with few distractions. 
9. Be aware of the optimal period of time for you to work on each task.
10. Respond to any email that you can answer quickly as soon as you read it. (See: [[Being Impatient]]). Backlogs can hold you back.
11. Out of 5, how much energy do you feel after spending time with someone? If 4-5, break down walls to see them. If 1-2, fade away.
12. Consistent sleeping schedule. Ideally have a reading ritual during this time.
13. Invest in personal relationships. Take social initiative. Never mind the awkwardness.
