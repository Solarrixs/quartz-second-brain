# LTC:CAC

Higher LTV:CAC → higher margins → higher valuation.

LTV - life time value (gross profit for a customer over time)

CAC - customer acquisition cost (total sales + marketing costs to acquire a customer)

If LTV:CAC ratio is 3x, then within 5 years, that means your company has efficient returns on sales and marketing spend.

Improving your LTV:CAC from 2x to 3x can nearly triple your valuation.

# Revenue (ARR)
Total revenue should see YoY growth.

# Churn
Monthly unit churn = lost customers/prior month total

Track retention by cohort

# Burn Rate
Monthly cash burn = cash balance at the beginning of the year minus cash balance end of the year / 12

Calculate runway and then establish a monthly budget.
