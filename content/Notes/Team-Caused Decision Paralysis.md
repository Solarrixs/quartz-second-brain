If you delay decisions because you are afraid how your team will react and are making decisions from a place of fear, you are not in charge. You need to be at peace with making your team unhappy, and comfortable with making the right decision even if itâ€™s unpopular. Otherwise, your team is running the company.

You need their input but ignore their output.

Companies are not democracies for a reason, unpopular decisions are often necessary. For example, as much as we all dislike them, sometimes layoffs are the right decision. No one would vote for a layoff, but as a leader you sometimes need to make that decision.
