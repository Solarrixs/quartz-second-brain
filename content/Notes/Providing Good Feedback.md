# Step 1
The first step is to ensure that someone is willing to receive feedback.
1. Get permission and sell why getting lots of feedback benefits them. Set expectations and ask "Are you open to receiving feedback from me? Be honest, yes or no."

# Step 2
When someone is open to feedback, your goal is to pitch the person on how to change.
1. Don't share all your cons to them. Empathize and craft your message around that
3. Approach with good intent. Soften the blow and share positive feedback
5. Limit self-expression and personal thoughts
7. Emphasize your willingness to disagree but still commit
8. Disagreements are always private
9. Share your "why" and thought process behind each feedback (DMs or Doc comments). Ask them what they think in the end. What are some parts that resonate the most with them?
10. Provide structural feedback first (high-level changes) before giving detailed line edits after they attempted a fix
11. "I believe you were trying to do X, and if so, this part fell flat because of Y. Consider trying Z instead."
12. Consider annotating screenshots for visual feedback
