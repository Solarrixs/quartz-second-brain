Some key factors to consider when you want to leave your job for another one:

People > Money
- The team provides our biggest source of happiness and unhappiness. Working with people you enjoy can have a meaningful impact on your health. A study found that a large majority of people are unhappy because of their boss!
- Talented individuals inspire other talents. You grow and learn more over time. And the biggest ROI you can get is learning skills for yourself.

Autonomy > Money
- Having a choice and voice in your job brings autonomy and ownership. Ideas matter here, and you feel that you have more control in the long run. Better for mental health.

Commute & Location > Pay
- Calculate your commute times. Those are unpaid hours, in addition to fuel or rail costs. Locations also matter a lot to where we work.
