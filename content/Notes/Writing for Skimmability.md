# Single-sentence Opener
Open your piece (and every subsequent section) with a single sentence.
- Open with 1 strong, declarative sentence.
- Open with a thought-provoking question.
- Open with a controversial opinion.
- Open with a moment in time.
- Open with a vulnerable statement.
- Open with a weird, unique insight.

# Bulleted Lists > Paragraphs
Your goal is for them to consume your work, and to not waste any of their time. Use lists as much as possible.

# Subheads
Subheads are bolded sentences throughout a piece that help the reader know "where" they are in your line of thinking.

- Split the page evenly visually to create symmetry
- Add enough splitting to give readers milestones to reach every time they scroll.

# Use the 1/3/1 Writing Rhythm
Alternate length of sentences and sectionsâ€”ideally opening and closing each section with a single sentence.

Traditionally, you will have a paragraph. Use the above rules to turn the opening and closing into a single sentence (1)
Turn the body (3, 4, etc) into bullets if possible
Separate the opening, closing, and body
Use a subhead to jump to the next section

# Styling
Short easy sentences
Fast rate of revelation that provides new info for the reader
Transition words
