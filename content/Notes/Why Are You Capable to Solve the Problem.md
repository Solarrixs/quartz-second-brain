The most consistent feedback founders get is "why are you the one to solve this problem."

Sometimes, its about expertise and pedigree. A founder without experience is not likely to succeed. Instead, emphasize an origin story to showcase their purpose in tackling this issue.

The origin story needs to be:
- Emotionally compelling
- Showcase your intimate understanding of the problem. What do I know that nobody else knows? What's my holy shit insight?
- What's my personal experience with this problem?
- Can I demonstrate technical competency and past successes?
- Why are you so passionate about this opportunity that youâ€™ll persevere when others give up?
