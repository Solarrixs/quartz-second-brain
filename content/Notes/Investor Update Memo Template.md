**EXEC SUMMARY**
- We crossed $XX MRR, growing YY% MoM.
- Hired *NAME* as our first *ROLE*.
- Nov-Dec is generally slow for sales, but we are doing well.

**METRICS**
- Revenue: $XX MRR (up from $YY last month, +ZZ%)
- NRR: 1XX% average at Month-6
- Cash: $X Million
- Burn: $YY/month
- Runway: XX months

**HIGHLIGHTS**
- Sarah has joined the team and is already making a huge impact taking over everything from onboardings to ongoing support as well as building out much better CX infra, documentation, and playbooks.
- We significantly increased our DEMO (S2) -> ONBOARDING SCHEDULED (O1) conversion rates, converting XX% of demos to onboardings. Of these, XX% already paid, rest are scheduled to onboard over next 2 weeks.

**LOWLIGHTS**
- There’s a lot more work to be done re Ops, especially going into the end of Q4 + end of year. Not strictly fun, but important that we handle it in a timely manner.

**SHOUT-OUTS**
- Jordi Hays for intro to Sarah Bai leading to closed hire.

**PRIORITIES FOR NEXT MONTH**
- Primary focus this month is Internal – improve internal product, automations, admin panel, releasing new marketing pages on our website, and CS infra.
- Revenue: goal is to onboard all scheduled onboardings, and then hopefully some more.

Thank you,
