A good way to begin is starting with "Tell me about a RECENT time when something happened. Keep it high level and how you addressed it. I will ask follow up question."
- Follow up questions will always need to include a timeline - you need to see how fast people move. Are they slow problem solvers?
- What was the outcome?
- How big of an effect was their choice and how did they do?

Prioritize communication in general. If they can't speak, don't hire. It'll lead to compounding problems. 

Always ask follow up like, what did you mean by that, how did that make you feel, tell me more about that situation.
