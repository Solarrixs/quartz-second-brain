# Before the Meeting
1. Invite the right people by knowing the goal you want to end the meeting with.
2. Ensure people know why they are being invited.
3. Send out a meeting invite link with a description that starts with "The goal of this meeting is to..."
4. Ensure people know what they need to do before hand.

(These meeting principles are based on the [[Important Frameworks#Bottom Line Up Front]] framework.)

# During the Meeting
1. Start the meeting by stating the goal of the meeting up front and what you expect "by the end of the meeting".
2. Keep everyone on track towards achieving the expected outcome of the meeting: “These are great points. For time purposes, I’d like to bring us back to X though. Is it ok to take this offline?”
3. Ensure everyone feels heard and foster disagreements. Ask people who haven't spoken on their opinions. When someone brings up a good point, say "That's a great point. Let's dive into that more." And add pause points: "Does anyone have concerns with this approach?"
4. Give 1-2 minutes of grace time, but no more than 5.
5. Nearing the end of the meeting, ask "Let's try to wrap up. Any big concerns that we should follow up on?" Then move onto actionable steps that people should complete.

# After the Meeting
1. Document all important points
2. Ping important action items to members in DM
