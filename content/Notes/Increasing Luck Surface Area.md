Does luck have a negative or positive connotation? I believe that most people view luck is negative. "Oh, it was just lucky that you won..."

But formulaic manifested luck isn't pure luck. Its probability of occurrence rises with the surface area of your luck-inducing actions. My favorite example: if a basketball rebounds weirdly and luckily falls right into your hands, that's blind luck. But to take that blind luck and manifest it - to hit the three pointer because you practiced for years versus missing due to not taking the actions you needed to to capitalize on that luck.

So how can you increase your luck?

First, be a connector of people. Opportunities will flow through you.

Second, work on your micros. Work on your worldview (better if you believe you are right and everyone else thinks you're wrong). You and a small group of rebels get the space to solve an important problem that might otherwise not get solved.

Another vastly important contributor to luck is your position in your life areas. If a smart, ambitious person stay and work in an area where they can have no long-term ambitions (McKinsey... ), how can they have the luck to achieve what they want? Impossible. Climb the right hill. Even if that means sacrificing your short-term status for long-term gains (although behavioral economists have revealed time and time again that people systematically overvalue near-term over long-term rewards).

1. Be open to new experiences. Try new things and meet new people.
	1. '' By increasing the number of random interactions in your life, you also increase the chances of fortunate encounters.
2. Network with diverse contacts for exposure to unique opportunities.
3. Positive and optimistic outlook.
4. Be well-prepared to capitalize on opportunities when they arise.
5. Learning from failure.
