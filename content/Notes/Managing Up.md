- Make it super easy in conversations by being direct. Concise as possible.
- Show your thought process. It makes them easier to review your decisions.
- Flag potential issues for a product, and suggest possible outcomes to take.
- Bring solutions / possible actions to do with every complaint.
- Action items/questions at the top, context labeled below.
- Over communicate to your manager. Say what you're going to do, tell your manager you're doing it, tell your manager you did it. Do it until they tell you to stop communicating so much.
- Anticipate questions and answer those questions before they are asked.
- Be explicit about what you need.
- Be as self-directed and independent as possible. Go work, don't ask!
- Whenever you get a project, get what you need and set expectations. Ask: why now for doing this> Timeline and priority? What does good enough look like> Who can help or offer resources? When would you like an update - after first draft or after final version? Finally, don't give up on the progress or project without confirmation!
- Instead of waiting for things to be assigned to you, preemptively figure out what needs to be done.
- When picking up conversations with upper management, always encourage interruption, and always provide context. Remember to use [[Important Frameworks#Bottom Line Up Front]].
