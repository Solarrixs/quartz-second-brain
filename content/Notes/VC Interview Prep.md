# Fit/Background

## Walk me through your resume
Highlight passion for nurturing and investing in startups
Express preference for client-oriented and relationship building aspects (such as in IB)
Make a more substantial and enduring impact by collaborating with early companies

## Why VC?
Collaborating with startups, nurturing growth, discovering promising ventures
Draw connections with previous involvement with companies / early stage businesses

Maybe speak about improving society:
"The best VCs get to improve society in two ways: by helping new companies take shape and contribute new technologies and medical cures into the world, and by helping universities and foundations execute their missions to educate and improve people’s lives."

Example:
- Kleiner Perkins kicked off the clean tech bubble in 2007, and led to tens of billions of dollars into the industry, invested talent into those industry, and provided an incentive to improve clean technologies. It led to the rise of Tesla.
- Although a lot of VCs lost money in the clean tech bubble, the opportunity to generate returns today might not exist if someone hadn’t been willing to lose money decades ago. No venture capitalist does this altruistically – they’re driven by the small, against-all-odds chance that this too-early technology might be the next big thing – but in their mistakes they create opportunity for others. 
- The best thing they can do is to identify, encourage, and fund the entrepreneurs who actually create value by building great things. 

The mirage are making a lot of money, helping entrepreneurs, not doing operations, etc. But the real long term reasons to stay in is to have a passion for creating the future, working with good people you pick and find joy in that, understanding trends in all of life, and learning and unlearning everyday.

## How would you think through an investment decision?
ensuring alignment with your firm's size, stage, and strategic focus. It's imperative that the start-up’s stage and industry match your firm's investment criteria

market research to estimate the start-up’s growth potential and eventual valuation. The goal is to determine if a reasonable multiple, such as 10x for a Series A or 5x for a Series B deal, can be achieved.

start-up’s team, product, and competitive advantages is crucial. Due diligence includes requests for data on users, customers, financial performance, clinical trial data (for biotech firms), and SaaS metrics (for enterprise software companies), competitors

assessing risk takes a backseat in early-stage VC investments, as it's understood
that the majority of start-ups face the risk of failure. Instead, the primary focus remains on the potential upside and growth prospects

obtaining potential investments from professional networks and connections through initial review of each startup pitch deck or meeting

## What is important in VC term sheets?
investment amount, pre, post money valuations
dilution mechanisms

# Technicals
## Pre-money vs post-money valuations?
The "pre-money valuation" of a start-up refers to its Equity Value before it undertakes
the issuance of new shares to a VC firm, while the "post-money valuation" represents the Equity Value of the start-up after this transaction has taken place.

For example, if a company holds a pre-money valuation of $10 million before securing
$5 million in funding from a VC firm, its post-money valuation following the investment would be $15 million. In this scenario, the VC firm would possess ownership equivalent to $5 million out of the total post-money valuation of $15 million, which translates to a one-third ownership stake.

## What factors influence a startup's choice between priced equity, SAFE, or convertible
In a priced equity round, ownership is determined by the investment amount and premoney valuation, with investors holding an ownership stake calculated as Investment Amount / (Pre-Money Valuation + Investment Amount) post-investment. While this method provides clarity on ownership, it typically involves lengthier negotiations and potentially higher costs.

Conversely, some start-ups opt for alternatives like SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) notes and convertible notes, which postpone valuation and ownership
discussions. In these cases, investors contribute capital without an immediate allocation of shares; instead, conversion into equity occurs during the subsequent priced round.

While these instruments offer advantages in terms of speed and cost-effectiveness, they can introduce complications during the priced round. The conversion mechanism may lack clarity, leading to potential disputes with future investors.

Convertible notes, in particular, tend to be more intricate than SAFE notes, often
featuring additional terms such as accrued interest alongside the standard valuation cap and discount provisions.
