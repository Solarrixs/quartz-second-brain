Joining a startup meaning the startup needs people and doesn't have time to onboard you. So you need to onboard yourself.

1. What do I need to know to start contributing? Make a list of each task your job involves, and ask if you can do it. If not, put it on the need to learn before contributing list.
2. Join all meetings and know exactly what you need to learn from the meeting (the list above) and make a short request that's easy to say yes to, with an agenda for every informal chat you set up.
	- “Hey Sarah, my primary responsibility for the first month in this role is to support the Omega project. Jim said you were the right person to get my hands dirty. Can we meet so you can share: How I can get access to past data and the context? What’s been done so far? Is there anyone else I should be speaking to? Happy to do this over email too if that’s easier”
3. Take notes.
4. Be seen and communicate upwards so managers know you're busy.
	1. ex Tell your manager, “Can I send you a list of 5 things I think I need to hit the ground running? I’ll then set up a 1-1 and we could go through that.”

- What is the company’s mission, and how does my role contribute to it?
- What are my top 3 priorities, in order of importance?
- What will I get done by day 30? What will I get done by day 60? What by day 90? 
- Brainstorm the top 20 things you could be working on for the business.  
- Rank them in order of importance.
- Focus only on getting the top 3 done at any point in time. Don’t do anything else.
