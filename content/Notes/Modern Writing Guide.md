# Generating Ideas
Write down a list all of the problems I've solved and topics I've learned about over the last 2 years. Then group these into topics and choose the best 3. Next, add a level of specificity that makes the audience you're writing to the same person you were 2 years ago before you became an "expert".

## Generating Titles
Here is a good framework to generate a good title for your writing:
- Use numbers for "how many?"
- Have a clear "what"
- Name the audience directly to address the "who"
- Contain emotion to tell the reader how to feel
- Give an outcome or the promise to show readers what they'll learn

Titles should be:
- Clear, not clever
- Signals benefit
- Non-obvious title with a obvious subtitle

# Formatting Makes a Big Difference
Formatting is the easiest 10x you can make in your writing. Readers do not read linearly on the Internet. They jump around. They look for the next-easiest section to fly through. So frame your writing so the sections look easy to fly through. See [[Writing for Skimmability]] for an in-depth note but it consists of:
- Starting every section with a single sentence opener
- Use lists as much as possible
- Bolded subheads throughout your writing, split evenly to create symmetry and reader milestones
- Use the 1/3/1 writing rhythm
- Use as much space and single lines as possible
- Provide a fast rate of revelation (new info) for readers

# Recycling Content
There are a lot of mediums to publish your writing. Your blogs are your primary generation source, while all other social medias, YouTube, and newsletters are your regeneration sources.

The best content to recycle are your *evergreens*. These contents are either:
- Timeless Advice
- High Quality Advice

Regularly check your most popular posts and recycle them:
- Break a content idea down into multiple parts
- If you have a lot of content on one idea, create a summary article
- Review and update old posts, and edit the title so it stays relevant for the year
- Repost content into all social media platforms (Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, Medium, Threads, Reddit, Quora, Newsletters) periodically
- Compile information into an ebook, video, newsletter series, webinar, or infographic

## Writing a Non-fiction Book
Follow the idea of "lean startup". Write your first book as possible as possible (under 2 months).
- What questions will you answer?
- What are the big ideas to answer that question?
- What are the sub ideas (stories, stats, takeaways) that support the big ideas?
- How to order each big/sub ideas?

Don't hide drafts and start sharing and practicing online to get feedback.
- Share online and gather data on what's resonating
- Double down on your most-engaged category
- Expand popular posts with more stories and examples and recycle them into your book

Books tips:
- 200-300 pages
- Write for skimmability
- Price the book high ($25 roughly)

Choose a story pattern: google Kurt Vonnegut.
See: [[effective storytelling]] to craft good examples and stories.

# Frameworks
When writing, always consider the [[4A writing framework]]. It's an easy way to find a direction for your writing (actionable, analytical, aspirational, or anthropological), figure out how you approach your writing to your readers, and ensure adding credibility.

When writing a story, tell the end result of the story. Then go on to how it started, which encourages the readers to continue to find out the progression.

When writing a guide, always include an actionable takeaways section. This includes main premises, and how you can apply them.
