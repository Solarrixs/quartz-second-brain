Delegation is a **very** important skill that most people undervalue. Just calculate how much an hour is worth to you (perhaps your hourly wage) and subtract that from how much time a personal assistant can save. The ROI multiplies the wealthier you are.

So to delegate effectively:
1. Gauge task maturity. Hand difficult work to more experienced employees.
2. Define baseline standards through recordings.
3. Record the process.
4. Have assistants verify the success by writing their own SOP.
5. Monitor frequently with rapid feedback (see: [[Providing Good Feedback]]), then trail off and increase autonomy.
