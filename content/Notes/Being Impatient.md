Impatience is the fastest way to get better at things. Doesn't mean you're hasty. It might actually be a good thing. And the faster you process information or situation to move fast, the faster you can incorporate the result into what you do next.

Across a lot of domains, being fast correlates with effectiveness:
- A trivial example comes from email. Famous, powerful, and interesting people all personally read their email, respond fast (or as fast as they possibly can), and are openly curious about new things.
- In software engineering roles, when compared to low performers, the high performers have: 46 times more frequent code deployments and 440 times faster lead time from commit to deploy. Being impatient means more deployments. It means faster fixes. It means faster progress.
- The best founders work on small things but move quickly. Every time you talk to the best founders, they've gotten new things done.
- CEOs tend to be impatient.

What are some signs of impatience? Learning to type fast. Obsessed with optimization and keyboard shortcuts. Or generally, investments that save a lot of time in the future.

For startups, protect project and shipping momentum at all costs.
