A startup is a company designed to grow fast. Any newly founded company does not mean it is a startup, like a restaurant or a barbershop.

A fast growing startup must hit 2 factors:
1. A big market that can scale to size. The startup must make something lots of people want and be able to serve all those people anywhere.

Therefore, all founders must optimize for growth and measure all metrics related to growth.
- The growth rate should produces an S-curve. Initial period of no growth, a period of rapid growth and adoption, and a successful startup that is now a big company with limited growth.
- The length and slope of the company during the period of rapid growth and adoption  determines how big a company will be. And the company's growth rate is the slope.

Growth rate is the ratio of new customers to existing ones.
- So if you're getting a constant number of new customers every month, that means your growth rate is constant or decreasing.
- A good growth rate during YC is 5-7% a week.
- You can measure growth rate with active users and revenue.
- Every decision you make has to relate with the growth rate. Does your action or decision for the startup increase the growth rate?

A growth rate of 1% is vastly different from a growth rate of 5%. A growth rate of 1% is 1.7x growth rate a year, while a growth rate of 5% is a 12.6x growth rate a year.

Exponential growth is hard to understand. Everyone is surprised by fast growing startups.

Successful founders see problems in the world, whether they are good or bad problems. Because bad ideas to solve a problem might become a good idea because of technological change. And by entrenching your idea when only you realize the problem where the masses later realize the problem, you already have a head start over so many people.
