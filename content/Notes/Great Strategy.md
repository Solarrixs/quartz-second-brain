A strategy defines how you win. Thus, setting effective strategies are valuable.

1. Strategies should first be simple. A focused simple narrative (and North Star metric) is easier to be understood, remembered, and followed.
2. Strategies need to be honest. Face market threats (PESTEL, SWOT, Porter's Five Forces) and expose the field's constraints. Then you can work your way to solving challenges. Be specific about how you will address those challenges, backed by data - and the consequence of not doing so.
3. Strategies are a set of integrated choices that are clear and decisive. Self-consistency is a must. These choices must increase your odds of success, whether that be leveraging the strengths and assets specific to the people or focusing on activities that always will move you forwards, despite failures. These are called "asymmetric bets," such that a few large successes greatly pay for any failures you encounter along the way.
4. Strategies should define a long-term winning vision and allow you to formulate hypotheses to achieve the vision. How can I inspire people to work for us? What are we aspiring to achieve? What values do I never stray from? What are things the company should not do?
