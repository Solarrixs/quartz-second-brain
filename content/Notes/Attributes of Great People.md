	- '' When I talk to entrepreneurs and look back on my own journey, so much of the story and outcome is usually attributed to having the courage to be decisive in the most important moments, which are almost always filled with ambiguity at best and more often absolute existential chaos. It’s incredibly frightening to step up in those moments – it’s much easier to let them pass you by. But having the courage to make decisions during these defining times, whether they are right or wrong, is oftentimes the thing that makes or breaks a company.

	- One key measure of a player's success in real-time strategy games when you to have balance resources, attention, knowledge, factors, and guesswork, is their APM (Actions per minute).
