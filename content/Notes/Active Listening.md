# Handling Hard Conversations
1. What's the goal of your conversation? Too often a small thing becomes a big thing that's unfixable.
2. Prime the conversation by dampening the emotional sting. Say "I'm going to be blunt here so don't take whatever I say personally" or "Ok this is academic Maxx speaking, not friend Maxx speaking. Let's separate my personalities for the next 10 minutes, okay?"
3. Compliment 3 things then shift into the hard topic to say.
4. Frame the conversation as a mutual problem-solving session than a confrontation. Say we instead of I. Don't attack someone without a solution to fix it.

# Effective Listening
1. Stop doing anything else. Fully concentrate on their speech.
2. Set aside any judgement or assumptions when someone speaks.
3. Show the speaker you are listening - nod your head and make affirmative noises, maintain eye contact.
4. Briefly repeat what they say when they pause in short phrases. Show you understand their emotions and acknowledge them.
5. Never interrupt people when they speak. Be patient.
6. Ask sincere questions, and genuinely get interested in someone else.
3. Learn how to story tell. People are attracted to good stories and those who tell them.
4. Find someone charismatic to model - watch their interviews and presentations.

# Being a Good Podcast Guest

Ahead of the interview, always create talking points (make sure to sound conversational!):

- 2 minute script for "tell me about yourself"
- Principles and values you live by
- Books, podcasts, and resources you recommend
- Turning points in your life
- Weird hobbies and habits
- Proud projects

Always expand talking points with concrete examples.
