# Labor Perception Bias

People trust and value things more when they see the underlying work.

People dislike waiting in general, but if your users have high expectations (e.g., money transaction, migration, analysis, reporting), they become skeptical if the waiting time is too short. That's why displaying a labor screen right after a key action can improve your UX.

Sometimes it's better to slow things down to communicate effort.

# Conversion Techniques
Social Proof (Most popular on pricing)
Descending price anchor (highest $ on the left)
Removing the buy button with "Continue"

# Curiosity Gap

Gaps cause pain.

When we want to know something but can’t, it’s like having an itch that we need to scratch.

To take away the pain, we need to fill the knowledge gap.

# Chronoception

Your perception of time is subjective.

You can transform annoying waiting periods into delightful experiences by following five principles.1

Rule n°1 is simple: *never let users watch the soup come to a boil*. Entertain them.

# Be Mindful of Space

During the onboarding, users are immersed in a new world they don't know anything about, and that can be overwhelming.

Each word/element should earn its place on the screen by adding clear value for this precise moment.

# Minimize Task Perception

The first thing users do when they see a new form is estimating how much time is required to complete it.1

Separating fields in different steps eases the user's perception of how hard it is to complete.

Making the whole process look easy!

# Bridge the Gap

There are a lot of steps between "Add Photos" and successfully adding photos.

Remove all obstacles or questions users might have before they leave!

# Progressive Disclosure

It consists of showing only a few features initially, and then slowly adding options as users become better.

It's very powerful because it keeps simplicity for new users and brings power to advanced users.

During the onboarding, show only the core features of your product, and as users get familiar, unveil new options.

It keeps the interface simple for new users and progressively empowers advanced users.

# Social Status

We constantly measure our social value relative to others. It is the most important incentive and motivating force of social behavior.

# Banner Blindness

Users have learned to ignore content that resembles ads, is close to ads, or appears in locations dedicated to ads.1

However, when ads blend into the content that well, our brain gets confused. We block real content and watch ads, giving us a poor experience.

# Associative Priming

Words evoke associations in our minds.

For example, the word "low" has negative connotations. If repeatedly seen, it can inadvertently associate *YouTube* itself with "low" quality or value.

Priming consists of subtle visuals or **verbal suggestions** that influence how we behave.1

Here GoDaddy **increase people's motivation** by reminding them their soon-to-own domain will **help them achieve something great.**

# Pricing Psychology

Most pricing psychology principles rely on the Framing Effect and its related cognitive biases (anchoring, social proof, default bias, loss aversion, etc.).

# Loss Aversion

According to prospect theory, people perceive a potential loss as emotionally more severe than an equivalent gain.

# Wrongful Delegation

As a product expert, making decisions easier for people is your job.

If you're unsure about people's needs or wants, do not delegate the daunting task of filtering/understanding to your audience, decreasing the chances they'll take action.

Instead, do more research and testing, and learn more about product psychology to make better decisions.

# Immersive Experiences

Distraction-free interfaces can greatly increase your user engagement.

Whether that's for surveys (*Typeform*), productivity apps (*Notion*), and even content.

For example, we saw a 280% increase in user engagement for our case studies when we defaulted them to fullscreen.

# Sticky Content

1. Simple (very short and basic)
2. Unexpected (curiosity gap)
3. Concrete (e.g. relevant to COVID19)
4. Emotional (fun/fear, music-driven)
5. Story (e.g. woman looking for a mask)

Science shows that those are 5 of the key elements to make an idea stick.

# Alignment, Hierarchy, and Visual Balance

Create visual hierarchy to create balance. Make sure the reader has an idea of where to begin and finish reading in a narrative.

Add negative space. Let eyes rest.

Headers should be 2 times the main body text.

# Goal-Gradient Effect
Motivation increases as users get closer to their goal. Create ways to show that a user has already completed an action to motivate them to get closer to their goal.

# Fitt's Law
Touch targets should be large so users can accurately select them, have ample spacing between them, and allow users to easily interact with them (on the interface, like a phone or computer)

# Frame Around Rewards
Use celebration, achievements, and badges.
Design triggers to maintain a habit loop based on these rewards.

# Good Onboarding
What is the magic moment where they discover the value your product provides? Map out the current path they take from registration to outcome. Label each step as necessary, introduced later, or removed completely.

Create product bumpers to push people towards the desired outcome: welcome message, opt out product tour, progress bars, checklists, tooltips, empty states on UI that explains why it's empty and link to what they need to do to activate it
